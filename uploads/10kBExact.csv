null results, placing upper bounds on the vison energy inconsistent with the theory.
Chapter 5 discusses imaging of isolated vortices as a function of Tc . Vortex images
were fit with theoretical magnetic field profiles in order to extract the apparent vortex
size. The data for the lowest Tc ’s (5 and 6.5 K) show some inhomogeneity and suggest
that λab might be larger than predicted by the Tc ∝ ns (0)/m∗ relation first suggested
by results of Uemura et al. (1989) for underdoped cuprates. Finally, Chapter 6 examines observations of apparent “partial vortices” in the crystals. My studies of
these features indicate that they are likely split pancake vortex stacks. Qualitatively,
these split stacks reveal information about pinning and anisotropy in the samples.

Acknowledgements
First and foremost I want to thank my advisor Kathryn (Kam) Moler. It has been
an honor to be her first Ph.D. student. She has taught me, both consciously and unconsciously, how good experimental physics is done. I appreciate all her contributions
of time, ideas, and funding to make my Ph.D. experience productive and stimulating.
The joy and enthusiasm she has for her research was contagious and motivational for
me, even during tough times in the Ph.D. pursuit. I am also thankful for the excellent
example she has provided as a successful woman physicist and professor.
The members of the Moler group have contributed immensely to my personal and
professional time at Stanford. The group has been a source of friendships as well as
good advice and collaboration. I am especially grateful for the fun group of original
Moler group members who stuck it out in grad school with me: Brian Gardner, Per
Björnsson, and Eric Straver. I would like to acknowledge honorary group member
Doug Bonn who was here on sabbatical a couple years ago. We worked together (along
with Brian) on the spin-charge separation experiments, and I very much appreciated
his enthusiasm, intensity, willingness to do frequent helium transfers, and amazing
ability to cleave and manipulate ∼50 nm crystals. Other past and present group
members that I have had the pleasure to work with or alongside of are grad students
Hendrik Bluhm, Clifford Hicks, Yu-Ju Lin, Zhifeng Deng and Rafael Dinner; postdocs
Mark Topinka and Jenny Hoffman; and the numerous summer and rotation students
who have come through the lab.
In regards to the Hall probes, I thank Ds
